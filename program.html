<DIV class="clear" id="container"><!-- / content body -->    <!-- <h2>Poster Paper Submission</h2>
    <p>
    We solicit poster papers of early stage work, especially from students and young researchers to promote fruitful discussions with other participants and speed up the research. A poster paper must describe the content of the poster, such as the motivation of the work, the idea to approach the problem, and preliminary results (if any). Authors of non-accepted regular papers are encouraged to submit poster papers.<br><br> 

    A poster description must be <b>no more than 2 pages</b> in the 
    <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html"> 
    IEEE conference proceedings format</a>. Authors are welcome to submit their manuscripts
    at <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeenvmsa2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeenvmsa2018</a>. Accepted poster papers are <b>included</b> in IEEE Xplore.</br></br>

 
    When registering a poster paper to EasyChair, <font color=red><b>please append a prefix
    "[POSTER]"</b></font> before the title of your paper, for example:</br></br>
    "[POSTER] A Novel System Software for Non-volatime Memory".</br></br>

    The reviews are <b>single-blinded</b>. The names and affiliations of the authors are visible to the reviewers via EasyChair.</br></br></br>
 
    <b>Available Equipment:</b><br>
Each poster paper is provided a panel to set up the poster. In addition, a small
desk in front of the panel and power supply are provided if the authors wish to
conduct a demo of their systems. Note that the power supply can host only 1 or 2
laptops or mobile devices per poster, but servers and other energy-hungry systems
cannot be hosted. If the authors wish to conduct a demo, please contact the
program co-chairs no later than 30 days before the conference.-->

<b>Abstract:</b></br>
Flash memory opens a window of opportunities to a new world of computing over 20 years ago. Since then, storage devices gain their momentum in performance, energy, and even access behaviors. With over 1000 times in performance improvement over storage in recent years, there is another wave of adventure in removing traditional I/O bottlenecks in computer designs. In this talk, I shall first address the opportunities of new system architectures in computing. In particular, hybrid modules of DRAM and non-volatile memory (NVM) and all NVM-based main memory will be considered. I would also comment on a joint management framework of host/CPU and a hybrid memory module to break down the great memory wall by bridging the process information gap between host/CPU and a hybrid memory module. I will then present some solutions in neuromorphic computing which empower memory chips to own new capabilities in computing. In particular, I shall address challenges in in-memory computing in application co-designs and show how to utilize special characteristics of non-volatile memory in deep learning.</br></br>

<b>Abstract:</b></br>
Data is driving the transformation of the world, including the Internet of Everything, AI, and high-speed computing technologies. All of which are driving the digital transformation of all industries, and assisting humans and enterprises to make faster and more accurate decisions through data analysis and artificial intelligence. In such a transformation process, data storage and reading and writing behaviors play a very important role; for example, the computing results of artificial intelligence come from the collection of big data, the foundation of cloud services comes from the construction of data centers, and the server environment for high-speed computing comes from the matching stable and high-speed enterprise-level storage architecture. What kind of challenges and opportunities will enterprise SSDs face due to the transformation of these digital technologies? Welcome to join the keynote speech of K.S. Pua, CEO of Phison, to explore the latest enterprise SSD technologies and development trends.</br></br>
<b>Biography:</b></br>
KS Pua is the Founder, Chairman and CEO of Phison Electronics. He was born in a farming community Sekinchan in Selangor, Malaysia in 1974. At the age of 19, went to Taiwan with just US$4,000 in his pocket. With no relatives to help him, his only dream was to study hard, graduated from National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Hsinchu, Taiwan in 1997 and earned Master’s from NCTU in 1999. Mr. Pua and his four friends founded Phison Electronics Corp. in Taiwan. He designed and produced the world’s first single chip USB flash controller with other founders. Under his lead, the company has become a global leader in NAND Flash controller IC and storage solutions. </br>
As an entrepreneur, Mr. Pua is a successful high-teck entrepreneur and the recipient of the Ten Outstanding Young Malaysian Awards , and received Outstanding Young Entrepreneur Award, Outstanding Young Manager Award and The President Award of National Management Excellence Award from the Government. He was elected as Fellow of Chinese Society for Management Of Technology in 2009. In 2010, Phison enjoyed turnover of US$1.06 billion, and had become the largest market of flash-memory related products in Asia-Pacific area and was named 65th in U.S. magazine Bloomberg Businessweek’s Tech 100. From 2015 to present, production value of Phison were ranked 3rd of IC Design Houses in Taiwan IC design industry.</br>
<b>Phison Electronics Corporation</b></br>
Established in 2000 and headquartered in Hsinchu, Taiwan, Phison Electronics Corp. is a global leader in NAND Flash controller IC and storage solutions. The name Phi-son comes from “Five-Persons” since there were five founders who started the company as fresh graduates. In 2000, Phison developed world’s first single-chip USB flash drive controller, and successfully launched the USB-based product called Pen Drive. The term Pen Drive had since become symbolic in the realms of flash memory. For 20 years, Phison created of a wide range of innovative solutions over SSD, eMMC, UFS, SD and USB interfaces. Moreover, Phison provides system integration and total solution services across consumer, industrial and enterprise markets. As an active member in industry standards, Phison is on the Board of Directors for SDA, ONFI, UFSA and a contributor for JEDEC, PCI-SIG, MIPI, NVMe and IEEE-SA.</br></br>

<IMG height="170" alt="Hsu" src="director_Hsu.jpg"></IMG></br></br>
<b>Abstract:</b></br>
Confidential Computing is the protection of data in use, by performing computation within a trustworthy hardware-backed secure environment. This protection shields code and data from observation or modification by privileged software and hardware agents. In this talk, we will describe how the Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (Arm CCA) enables confidential computing in an Arm compute platform.</br></br>
<b>Biography:</b></br>
David Hsu is FAE Director of Arm, leading FAE team of Taiwan for closer collaboration and communications internally and externally to accomplish partners and customers solutions. He has over 20 years of professional experience in the semiconductor industry. David Hsu joined Arm in 2011 as a CPU FAE as well as responsible for product marketing and sales project management and then left in 2017. After then, he joined Intelligo, a start-up invested by MediaTek, leading the business development team to explore opportunities in Japan, Korea, and US. In 2019 David was recruited by Arm again as FAE director to drive Arm’s IP solutions adoption. In addition to Arm, David worked at Faraday, Alpha Imaging Technology (MediaTek subsidiary) and BenQ, focusing on IC design work ranging from architecture definition, RTL coding, front-end/back-end implementation to IC verification and testing. He has rich experience in pre-sales strategy set-up and sales enablement. David received a master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at National Chiao Tung University.</br></br>

</br>
<b>Description:</b> In Japan, semiconductor R&amp;D (research and development), including design, device, and process, is attracting a great deal of attention. In this session, distinguished professors from
three academic research centers will be invited to introduce their activities, focusing on their unique and advanced achievements. These three centers were recently selected as the core centers for the creation of next-generation semiconductor &quot;X-nics&quot; promoted by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). X-nics is a neologism meaning crossing (X-ing) or synergizing new designs, devices and processes. These presentations also briefly touch on the X-nics activity plan.
