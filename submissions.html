    <p>
    We solicit poster papers of early stage work, especially from students and young researchers to promote fruitful discussions with other participants and speed up the research. A poster paper must describe the content of the poster, such as the motivation of the work, the idea to approach the problem, and preliminary results (if any). Authors of non-accepted regular papers are encouraged to submit poster papers.<br><br> 

    A poster description must be <b>no more than 2 pages</b> in the 
    <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html"> 
    IEEE conference proceedings format</a>. Authors are welcome to submit their manuscripts
    at <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeenvmsa2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeenvmsa2018</a>. Accepted poster papers are <b>included</b> in IEEE Xplore.</br></br>

 
    When registering a poster paper to EasyChair, <font color=red><b>please append a prefix
    "[POSTER]"</b></font> before the title of your paper, for example:</br></br>
    "[POSTER] A Novel System Software for Non-volatime Memory".</br></br>

    The reviews are <b>single-blinded</b>. The names and affiliations of the authors are visible to the reviewers via EasyChair.</br></br></br>
 
    <b>Available Equipment:</b><br>
Each poster paper is provided a panel to set up the poster. In addition, a small
desk in front of the panel and power supply are provided if the authors wish to
conduct a demo of their systems. Note that the power supply can host only 1 or 2
laptops or mobile devices per poster, but servers and other energy-hungry systems
cannot be hosted. If the authors wish to conduct a demo, please contact the
program co-chairs no later than 30 days before the conference.-->
